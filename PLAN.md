# Project Plan: svg_removeoverlap Enhancements

This document outlines the plan for enhancing the `svg_removeoverlap` project. The goal is to improve its functionality, elegance, efficiency, and maintainability.

## High-Level Goals

1.  **Improve Code Quality and Robustness:** Refactor code for better readability, add comprehensive error handling, and ensure type safety.
2.  **Enhance User Experience:** Improve the CLI usability and provide clear documentation.
3.  **Optimize Performance:** Identify and address any performance bottlenecks in SVG processing.
4.  **Strengthen Testing:** Increase test coverage and ensure the reliability of the tool.
5.  **Modernize Tooling:** Ensure build tools, linters, and CI configurations are up-to-date and effective.
6.  **Maintain Comprehensive Documentation:** Keep all project documentation (README, changelog, API docs) current and informative.

## Phases

1.  **Initial Setup & Planning (Current Phase):**
    *   Analyze existing codebase.
    *   Create `PLAN.md` and `TODO.md`.
    *   Establish initial list of tasks.
    *   Set up `CHANGELOG.md` for tracking progress.

2.  **Core Logic and CLI Enhancements:**
    *   Refactor `remover.py` for clarity and robustness.
    *   Improve error handling and logging throughout the application.
    *   Enhance CLI argument parsing and user feedback in `__main__.py`.

3.  **Testing and Performance:**
    *   Increase unit and integration test coverage.
    *   Investigate and implement performance optimizations if feasible.

4.  **Documentation and Tooling Review:**
    *   Update all user-facing and developer documentation.
    *   Review and update build system, CI/CD pipeline, and pre-commit hooks.

5.  **Final Review and Release Preparation:**
    *   Conduct a final code review.
    *   Ensure all tests pass and documentation is complete.
    *   Prepare for a potential new release version.

This plan will be updated as the project progresses. Specific tasks will be tracked in `TODO.md`.
